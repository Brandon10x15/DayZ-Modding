## Object Spawning
DayZ has released a new way to spawn objects and buildings in update 1.15.  
  
The first thing you'll need to do is `Enable cfgGameplay.json` in your Nitrado settings.  
 - It should be a check box at the bottom of the **General** settings menu in the Nitrado dashboard.  
  
To use spawn objects correctly, you'll need to use the DayZ PC version and a tool to get the Y height variable.
 - I like to use [Community Offline Mode](https://github.com/Arkensor/DayZCommunityOfflineMode)
