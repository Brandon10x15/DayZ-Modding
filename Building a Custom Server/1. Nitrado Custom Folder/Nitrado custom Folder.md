## Nitrado /custom folder explained
If you use the Nitrado dashboard, you probably have seen this message:  
  
```When adding your own configuration files for DayZ, please place them into the subfolder named "custom" within the respective mission folder. Files added in other places will be ignored.```  
  
This means, all custom files should go into `/dayz.Offline.chernarusplus/custom` or `/dayz.Offline.enoch/custom`.  
The **/custom** folder does not support subfolders, all files must be placed in the root of the **/custom** folder.
